132 days ago you went to Tesco to buy marshmallow 
but end up buying chocolate because you had not enough money to buy marshmallow.
or a pack of four donuts.
Walking down the road with handfull of chocolates, staring at them, you were intrigued by the feeling that these chocolates weren't normal.
Something felt strange, but you didn't knew what.
An Aura of evil you felt, hovering upon you, As if it was waiting for you from ages ago.
The more you thought about it, stronger the feeling became. Feeling, that has chilled you to the core, haunting you, tearing you inside out.
Immersed in the swamp of terror, you took your eyes away from those wierd chocolates.
Waiting for you was the scene of a cementary, dark, forbidden, gloomy as hell.
You weren't were you were supposed to be,.................
